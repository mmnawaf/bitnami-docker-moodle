# How to deploy Moodle<sup>TM</sup> in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami Chart for Moodle<sup>TM</sup> GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/moodle).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`3`, `3-debian-10`, `3.10.0`, `3.10.0-debian-10-r41`, `latest` (3/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/3.10.0-debian-10-r41/3/debian-10/Dockerfile)

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Docker Image for Moodle<sup>TM</sup> is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/moodle).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/moodle:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/moodle/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/moodle:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/moodle:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle.git#master:3/debian-10'
```

## How to use this image

Moodle<sup>TM</sup> requires access to a MySQL or MariaDB database to store information. We'll use the [Bitnami Docker Image for MariaDB](https://www.github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb) for the database requirements.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of this repository contains a functional [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. Run the application using it as shown below:

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Using the Docker Command Line

If you want to run the application manually instead of using `docker-compose`, these are the basic steps you need to run:

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create moodle-network
```

#### Step 2: Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

```console
$ docker volume create --name mariadb_data
$ docker run -d --name mariadb \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MARIADB_USER=bn_moodle \
  --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_moodle \
  --network moodle-network \
  --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb \
  bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

#### Step 3: Create volumes for Moodle<sup>TM</sup> persistence and launch the container

```console
$ docker volume create --name moodle_data
$ docker run -d --name moodle \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=bn_moodle \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_moodle \
  --network moodle-network \
  --volume moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle \
  bitnami/moodle:latest
```

Access your application at *http://your-ip/*

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami/moodle` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run. Additionally you should mount a volume for persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define the Docker volumes named mariadb_data and moodle_data. The Moodle<sup>TM</sup> application state will persist as long as volumes are not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of volumes, you can mount host directories as data volumes. Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```diff
   mariadb:
     ...
     volumes:
-      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
+      - /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb
   ...
   moodle:
     ...
     volumes:
-      - 'moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle'
+      - /path/to/moodle-persistence:/bitnami/moodle
   ...
-volumes:
-  mariadb_data:
-    driver: local
-  moodle_data:
-    driver: local
```

> NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

#### Step 1: Create a network (if it does not exist)

```console
$ docker network create moodle-network
```

#### Step 2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume

```console
$ docker volume create --name mariadb_data
$ docker run -d --name mariadb \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MARIADB_USER=bn_moodle \
  --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_moodle \
  --network moodle-network \
  --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
  bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

#### Step 3. Create the Moodle<sup>TM</sup> container with host volumes

```console
$ docker volume create --name moodle_data
$ docker run -d --name moodle \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=bn_moodle \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_moodle \
  --network moodle-network \
  --volume /path/to/moodle-persistence:/bitnami/moodle \
  bitnami/moodle:latest
```

## Configuration

## Environment variables

When you start the Moodle<sup>TM</sup> image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

  ...
  environment:
    - MOODLE_PASSWORD=my_password
  ...
```

 * For manual execution add a `--env` option with each variable and value:

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name moodle -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --env MOODLE_PASSWORD=my_password \

##### Example

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a Gmail account:

 * Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
  moodle:
    ...
    environment:
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=bn_moodle
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_moodle
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MOODLE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name moodle -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --env MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=bn_moodle \
    --env MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_moodle \
    --env MOODLE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
    --env MOODLE_SMTP_PORT=587 \
    --env MOODLE_SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
    --env MOODLE_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password \
    --env MOODLE_SMTP_PROTOCOL=tls \
    --network moodle-tier \
    --volume /path/to/moodle-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/moodle:latest
  ```

### Installing additional language packs

By default, this container packs a generic English version of Moodle<sup>TM</sup>. Nevertheless, more Langage Packs can be added to the default configuration using the in-platform Administration [interface](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Language_packs#Language_pack_installation_and_uninstallation). In order to fully support a new Language Pack it is also a requirement to update the system's locales files. To do that, you have several options:


#### Build the default image with the `EXTRA_LOCALES` build-time variable

You can add extra locales using the `EXTRA_LOCALES` build-time variable when building the Docker image. The values must be separated by commas or semicolons (and optional spaces), and refer to entries in the `/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED` file inside the container.

For example, the following value would add French, German, Italian and Spanish, you would specify the following value in `EXTRA_LOCALES`:

    fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8, de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8, it_IT.UTF-8 UTF-8, es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8

> NOTE: The locales `en_AU.UTF-8 UTF-8` and `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` will always be packaged, defaulting to `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`.

To use `EXTRA_LOCALES`, you have two options:

* Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

  ```yaml
  moodle:
  ...
    # image: 'bitnami/moodle:3' # remove this line !
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        - EXTRA_LOCALES=fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8, de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8, it_IT.UTF-8 UTF-8, es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8
  ...
  ```

* For manual execution, clone the repository and run the following command inside the `3/debian-10` directory:

  ```console
  $ docker build -t bitnami/moodle:latest --build-arg EXTRA_LOCALES="fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8, de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8, it_IT.UTF-8 UTF-8, es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8" .
  ```

#### Enable all supported locales using the `WITH_ALL_LOCALES` build-time variable

You can generate all supported locales by setting the build environment variable `WITH_ALL_LOCALES=yes`. Note that the generation of all the locales takes some time.

To use `WITH_ALL_LOCALES`, you have two options:

* Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

  ```yaml
  moodle:
  ...
    # image: 'bitnami/moodle:3' # remove this line !
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        - WITH_ALL_LOCALES=yes
  ...
  ```

* For manual execution, clone the repository and run the following command inside the `3/debian-10` directory:

  ```console
  $ docker build -t bitnami/moodle:latest --build-arg WITH_ALL_LOCALES=yes .
  ```

#### Extending the default image

Finally, you can [extend](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle#extend-this-image) the default image and adding as many locales as needed:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/moodle
RUN echo "es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen && locale-gen
```

Bear in mind that in the example above `es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8` is the locale needed for the desired Language Pack to install. You may change this value to the locale corresponding to your pack.

## Logging

The Bitnami Docker image for Moodle<sup>TM</sup> sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs moodle
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose logs moodle
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Maintenance

### Backing up your container

To backup your data, configuration and logs, follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Stop the currently running container

```console
$ docker stop moodle
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose stop moodle
```

#### Step 2: Run the backup command

We need to mount two volumes in a container we will use to create the backup: a directory on your host to store the backup in, and the volumes from the container we just stopped so we can access the data.

```console
$ docker run --rm -v /path/to/moodle-backups:/backups --volumes-from moodle busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/moodle /backups/latest
```

### Restoring a backup

Restoring a backup is as simple as mounting the backup as volumes in the containers.

For the MariaDB database container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
+  --volume /path/to/mariadb-backups/latest:/bitnami/mariadb \
   bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

For the Moodle<sup>TM</sup> container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name moodle \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/moodle-persistence:/bitnami/moodle \
+  --volume /path/to/moodle-backups/latest:/bitnami/moodle \
   bitnami/moodle:latest
```

### Upgrade this image

> **NOTE:** Since Moodle(TM) 3.4.0-r1, the application upgrades should be done manually inside the docker container following the [official documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/Upgrading).
> As an alternative, you can try upgrading using an updated Docker image. However, any data from the Moodle(TM) container will be lost and you will have to reinstall all the plugins and themes you manually added.

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Moodle<sup>TM</sup>, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Moodle<sup>TM</sup> container. For the MariaDB upgrade see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/moodle:latest
```

#### Step 2: Stop the running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker-compose stop moodle
```

#### Step 3: Take a snapshot of the application state

Follow the steps in [Backing up your container](#backing-up-your-container) to take a snapshot of the current application state.

#### Step 4: Remove the currently running container

Remove the currently running container by executing the following command:

```console
docker-compose rm -v moodle
```

#### Step 5: Run the new image

Update the image tag in `docker-compose.yml` and re-create your container with the new image:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Customize this image

The Bitnami Docker image for Moodle<sup>TM</sup> is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

- Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the ports used by Apache for HTTP and HTTPS, by setting the environment variables `APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER` and `APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER` respectively.
- [Adding custom virtual hosts](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#adding-custom-virtual-hosts).
- [Replacing the 'httpd.conf' file](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#full-configuration).
- [Using custom SSL certificates](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/moodle
## Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

- Install the `vim` editor
- Modify the Apache configuration file
- Modify the ports used by Apache

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/moodle
LABEL maintainer "Bitnami <containers@bitnami.com>"

## Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0
## Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim
## Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

## Enable mod_ratelimit module
RUN sed -i -r 's/#LoadModule ratelimit_module/LoadModule ratelimit_module/' /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf

## Modify the ports used by Apache by default
# It is also possible to change these environment variables at runtime
ENV APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181
ENV APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER=8143
EXPOSE 8181 8143
```

Based on the extended image, you can update the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository to add other features:

```diff
   moodle:
-    image: bitnami/moodle:latest
+    build: .
     ports:
-      - '80:8080'
-      - '443:8443'
+      - '80:8181'
+      - '443:8143'
     environment:
       ...
+      - PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=512m
     ...
```

# Notable Changes

## 3.9.0-debian-10-r17

- The size of the container image has been decreased.
- The configuration logic is now based on Bash scripts in the *rootfs/* folder.
- The Moodle<sup>TM</sup> container image has been migrated to a "non-root" user approach. Previously the container ran as the `root` user and the Apache daemon was started as the `daemon` user. From now on, both the container and the Apache daemon run as user `1001`. You can revert this behavior by changing `USER 1001` to `USER root` in the Dockerfile, or `user: root` in `docker-compose.yml`. Consequences:
  - The HTTP/HTTPS ports exposed by the container are now `8080/8443` instead of `80/443`.
  - Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed when data is persisted using docker or docker-compose. We highly recommend migrating the Moodle<sup>TM</sup> site by exporting its content, and importing it on a new Moodle<sup>TM</sup> container. Follow the steps in [Backing up your container](#backing-up-your-container) and [Restoring a backup](#restoring-a-backup) to migrate the data between the old and new container.

## 3.7.1-debian-9-r38 and 3.7.1-ol-7-r40

- It is now possible to use existing Moodle<sup>TM</sup> databases from other installations, as requested in [#95](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle/issues/95). In order to do this, use the environment variable `MOODLE_SKIP_INSTALL`, which forces the container not to run the initial Moodle<sup>TM</sup> setup wizard.

## 3.7.0-debian-9-r12 and 3.7.0-ol-7-r13

- This image has been adapted so it's easier to customize. See the [Customize this image](#customize-this-image) section for more information.
- The Apache configuration volume (`/bitnami/apache`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the Apache configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom Apache configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- The PHP configuration volume (`/bitnami/php`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the PHP configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom PHP configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/php/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- Enabling custom Apache certificates by placing them at `/opt/bitnami/apache/certs` has been deprecated, and support for this functionality will be dropped in the near future. Users wanting to enable custom certificates are advised to mount their certificate files on top of the preconfigured ones at `/certs`.
